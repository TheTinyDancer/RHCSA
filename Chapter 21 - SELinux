Context Labels:

User = _u
Role = _r
Type = _t

Commands:

getenforce - see selinux mode
setenforce <1 or 0> - set selinux mode
sestatus -v  - Show detailed information about current running SELinux status
ls -Z   -  Show file context
ps Zaux   - Show process context
semanage - Writes new context to SELinux policy
chcon - Writes new context to the filesystem but not policy and will be overwritten when relabeled. DO NOT USE THIS
semanage fcontext -a -t <context type> <files to change>  = -a is to add context and -t is change context types. This covers all new and existing files.
restorecon -R -v <directory> = Apply new context policy to directory
getsebool -a  = See booleans that exist to find the one you need use grep.
semanage boolean -l  =  Same as above
setsebool <boolean> <on/off>  = Change a boolean   THIS ISNT PERMANENT
setsebool -P <boolean> <on/off>  = Change a boolean PERMANENTLY

Troubleshooting SELinux:

SELinux messages are logged in audit logs with type=AVC so just 'grep AVC'
install setroubleshoot-server to use sealert and make logs more readable.
