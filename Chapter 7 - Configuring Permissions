#Commands
find <directory> <options> <option parameter> = search files based on parameters
chown <user> <file> = set ownership of file
chgrp <group> <file> - set group of file
groups <user> = view all groups a user belongs to
newgrp <group> = change the current users effective primary group until they use 'exit' at which point their primary group will revert to the original
gpasswd <group> = set a group password so that users who are not a part of the group can use the newgrp if they know the password.

#chmod

#Numeric & Alpha representations
Used to set the permissions for user, group, and others of a file or directory.
Read= 4
Write= 2
Execute= 1
7 = r+w+x
6 = r+w
5 = r+x
3 = w+x

#SUID
allows an executable to run as root instead of the permission level of the logged in user.
chmod 4755 /executable 
chmod u+s /executable

#SGID
allows an executable to be run at the permission level of the group or when applied to a directory is sets default group ownerships on all files and subdirectories,
meaning that any files or directories created under that directory will now be given the group owner of the main directory.
chmod 4755 /executable 
chmod g+s /directory

#Sticky Bit
Used to protect files from accidental deletion. When set only the owner is able to delete their own files under that directory. Useful for shared directories
chmod 1755 /directory 
chmod +t /directory
