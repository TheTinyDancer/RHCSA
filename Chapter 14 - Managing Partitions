MBR/GPT Partitions
  MBR partitioning scheme - Master boot record sits on the bootable device and contains the boot loader and partition table.
    First 512  bytes on the hard drive.
  GPT partitioning scheme - GUID Partition Table is used by UEFI as the replacement for BIOS systems. GPT is backwards compatible though and can be used with BIOS as well.
  GPT offers the following benefits = max partition size of 8ZiB, max of 128 partitions, backup copy of GPT at the end of the disk for backup purposes.
  
Managing Partitions and File Systems
  Fdisk utility used for MBR, Gdisk used for GPT.
  Common Disk Device types:
    /dev/sda - hard disk using SCSI
    /dev/hda - legacy IDE disk type
    /dev/vda - disk ina kvm virtual machine
    /dev/xvda - disk in a Xen virtual machine
  Primary Partitions - Allow you create file systems on a disk.
  Extended Partitions - Used only for the purpose of creating logical partitions. Cannot create file systems directly on an extended partition.
  File Systems:
    XFS - Default file system in RHEL 7
    Ext4 - Legacy default file system in RHEL
    BtrFS - New file system receiving support in later RHEL 7 versions
    NTFS - Not supported on RHEL 7
    VFAT - Offer compatibility with Windows and MAC
Handling SWAP
  SWAP = Used to improve Linux Kernel memory especially when you're low on RAM.
  SWAP Partition = Is a dedicated partition used for SWAP.
  SWAP file = is a file that is used for swap and can be used in a hurry to create swap.
Mounting
  /etc/fstab = Used to automatically mount during start up.
    Six fields (in order) = Device,  Mount Point,  File System,   Mount Options,  Dump Support,   Automatic Check
    Common Mount Options:
      auto / noauto = File will [not] be mounted automatically
      acl = Adds the support for the file system access control lists
      user_xattr = Adds support for user extended attributes
      ro = Mounts the file system in read-only mode
      atime / noatime = Disables or enables access time modifications
      noexec / exec = Denies or allows execution of program files from the file system
      _netdev = Use this to mount a network file system. This tells fstab to wait unti the network is available before mounting this file system.
    
    
 Commands
  mkfs -t <filesystem type> /dev/sda3
  tune2fs -l = Shows file system properties including labels.
  tune2fs -L = Set a label on the file system.
  xfs_admin = used to manage XFS file system.
  dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1 count-100  = Creates a swap file of 100MiB
  mkswap /swapfile  = mark /swapfile as a swap file.
  swapon /swapfile  = turn on the swapfile.
  mount <disk device> <mount point>  = Used to mount a device.
  umount <disk device> OR <mount point>  = Will disconnect either way.
  blkid = Gets an overview of the current file systems on your systems and the UUID that is used by that file system.
  mount "UUID=<uuid>" <mount point>
  mount LABEL=<label> <mount point>
