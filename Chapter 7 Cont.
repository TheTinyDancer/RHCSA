#Access Control Lists
Used as a way to add greater functionality to servers. Not all utilities support ACLs so there's always a risk to lose ACL settings when backing up, copying, or moving files. 

#ACL Considerations
Not all backup software will preserve these settings.
Before applying ACLs you have to prepare the file system to handle the extra metadata by applying acl option in /etc/fstab

#Backup/Restore ACL Settings
getfacl -R 'directory to backup' > file.acl
setfacl --restore=file.acl

#View ACL Settings
getfacl 'directory'

#Set ACL Settings
setfacl <option> <permissions> <directory>
setfacl -m g:sales:rx /dir = -m modify current ACL to allow group (g) to allow sales to read and execute for /dir

#Set Default ACL to be applied to directory
setfacl -m d:g:sales:rx /dir  = d: states the following permission will be set to all subsequent files and directories created under /dir 

#ACL Options
-m = modify current ACL
-R = appliy to directory and subdirectories

#User-Extended Attributes
Allows the ability to add extended attributes to files and folders

#Considerations
user_xattr mount option must be used and set in /etc/fstab.
This is highly experimental and may not be supported by a lot of applications therefore making it useless depending on the intended use.

#Attributes
A = access time is not modified
a = allows file to be added but not removed
c = makes sure file is compressed first time engine get active. For volume level compression
D = changes to files written directly to disk and not cache first
d = file is not backed up when dump utility run
i = means file is immutable. No changes can be made to the file at all.
s = overwrite blocks where file was stored with a 0's after deletion to ensure file cant be recovered.
u = saves undelete information, allows an utility to be developed that works to salvage deleted files.

#Apply attributes
chattr +s somefile = adds the attribute 's' to somefile
cattr -s somefile = removes the attribute 's' from somefile
