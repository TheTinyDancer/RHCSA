Configuring Logging

Different types of system logging:
  Direct write= write information directly to the log files.
  rsyslogd=a service that takes care of managing centralized log files.
  journald=Service that is deeply integrated with systemd, which allows administrators to read detailed information from the journal.
  
Understanding Journald & Rsyslogd
  Journald collects messages from the kernel, the entire boot procedure, and services and writes these messages to an event journal. Because the messages in journal are not persistent between reboots messages are also forwarded to rsyslogd service.
   Rsyslogd writes messages to different files in the /var/log directory. Rsyslog also offers features that do not exist in journald, such as centralized logging and filtering messages by using modules.
   Files in /var/log/ that are written by rsyslogd must be monitored.
   
Log file format (in order)
  Date and time
  Host
  Service or process time
  Message content
 
System log files
  /var/log/messages= Generic log file where most messages are written
  /var/log/dmesg= Contains kernel log messages
  /var/log/secure= Contains authentication-related messages.
  /var/log/boot.log= Contains logs related to startup
  /var/log/audit/audit.log= Contains audit messages, SELinux also writes here.
  /var/log/maillog= Mail-related messages
  /var/log/samba= Log files for the samba service
  /var/log/sssd= Logs for SSSD service and authentication
  /var/log/cups= Printer logs
  /var/log/httpd= Apache writes messages here directly not through rsyslog
  
Configuring Rsyslog
  facility=category of information, this is fixed and cant be extended for backwards compatibility reasons.
  priority= Severity of message that needs to be logged. All messages at or above this severity are automatically logged.
  destination=Defines where the messages should be logged.
  
Log Facilities:
  daemon= Generic facility for nonspecified daemons
  kern= kernel messages
  lpr=Messages from legacy lpd print system
  mail=Email-related messages
  mark= Special facility that can be used to write a marker periodically
  news= Messages generated by the NNTP news system
  security= Same as auth/authpriv. Should not be used anymore
  syslog= Messages generated by the syslog system
  user= Messages generated in user space
  uucp= Messages from legacy UUCP
  local0-7= Messages from any services configured by any local facilities.

Log Priorities
  debug= Give as much information as possible
  info= Messages about normal service operation
  notice= informational messages about issues that may be an issue later
  warning/warn= Something is suboptimal but not a real error yet
  err/error= Noncritical error
  crit= Critical error
  alert= Used when availability of the servce is about to be discontinued
  emerg/panic= Messages used when availability of the service is discontinued
  
Log commands/Files
 
 tail -f <logfile>  = show in real time lines being added to the log file, press ctrl-c to close it.
 /etc/rsyslog.conf = Where to configure rsyslog
