Systemd
  - System and service manager.
  - Starts (units). Many units types, but the main one is services.

Grub
  - May want to remove rhgb and quiet in grub so you can see how everything boots up with error messages and all.

Locations:

/usr/lib/systemd/system - System default unit files
/etc/systemd/system - System-specific modifications are stored here.
/run/systemd/system - Runtime configuration is generated automatically here.
/etc/default/grub - This is where grub changes should be made as it will be used to create grub2.cf

Commands:

systemctl show sshd - Shows all systemd options that can be configured.
systemctl enable <service> - Service will be started on bootup
systemctl disable <service> - Service wont be started on bootup
man 7 bootparam - List of boot parameters while starting the kernel.
